# Early Access Feedback Summary (n=26)

## 1) Who answered

**Business stage**
- Already selling (0–50 orders/month): ~50%
- Building / launching store: ~35%
- High volume (200+ orders/month): ~15%

Implication: validates MVP focus on small-but-already-selling POD merchants.

**Geography**
- Majority: United States
- Also: Europe, UK, Asia

Implication: international audience from day one.

**POD providers**
- Printify: ~54% overall
- Printify among active sellers (0–50 orders/month): ~77%

Implication: Printify-first is the right initial integration choice.

## 2) Main problems today

Top frustrations with existing personalization tools:
- Too complex to set up and manage (layers, UI, configuration friction)
- Designs look generic / clipart-like
- Too slow to create and test new designs
- Many merchants don’t use any tool yet because current options feel overkill

## 3) What merchants want to improve in the next 90 days

Top priorities:
- Differentiation (stand out, not be a commodity)
- Automation (less manual design work)
- Faster iteration (test trends & niches quickly)
- Higher margins through premium personalization

## 4) Pricing expectations & cost sensitivity

Preferred pricing models:
- Pay-as-you-go: ~50%
- Subscription with quota: ~35%
- Hybrid: ~12%

By segment:
- Small/mid sellers (0–50 orders): strongly prefer pay-as-you-go
- High-volume sellers: more open to subscriptions

Implication: the safest MVP pricing is usage-based with strong cost visibility and caps.

## 5) Qualitative themes

Recurring themes:
- Strong interest and curiosity
- Requests for Etsy / WooCommerce support (not MVP, but relevant later)
- Desire for simple setup, better design quality, clear pricing, and trial before commitment
- No strong resistance to AI; trust depends on quality and preview reliability

## 6) Key conclusions

Validated:
- The problem is real
- MVP ICP is correct
- Printify-first is the right move
- Merchants want simplicity + premium results, not more features
- Pay-as-you-go with cost control is the most accepted starting model
